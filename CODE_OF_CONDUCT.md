# Code of Conduct

## Introduction

Our project is dedicated to providing a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, religion (or lack thereof), or technology choices. We do not tolerate harassment in any form. Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate for any project venue, including talks, workshops, parties, Twitter and other online media. Anyone violating these rules may be sanctioned or expelled from the project without reimbursement at the discretion of the project organizers.

- Publishing other's private information, such as physical or electronic address, without explicit permission.

## Consequence of Unacceptable Behavior

Unacceptable behavior from any community member will not be tolerated. Anyone engaging in unacceptable behavior may be asked to stop, warned, or expelled from the community, either temporarily or permanently, at the discretion of the community organizers.
